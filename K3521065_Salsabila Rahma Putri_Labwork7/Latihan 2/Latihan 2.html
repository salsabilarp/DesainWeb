    <h1>PTIK FKIP UNS</h1>
    <p>The <mark id="blok">Faculty of Teacher Training and Education</mark>, <mark id='blok'>Sebelas Maret University</mark>, Surakarta is an <mark id="blok">Educational Personnel 
      Education Institution (LPTK)</mark> which has 24 study programs in 6 majors. Each study program has its own characteristics in producing 
      <mark id="blok">superior, strong and intelligent educational staff.</mark>
      <br><br>
      The <mark id="blok">Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK)</mark> study program is planned to take shelter in the management of the 
      <mark id="blok">Engineering and Vocational Education (PTK)</mark> department. This placement revises our previous statement, where the PTIK study 
      program is under the P.MIPA department. PTIK is a study program that will produce graduates who are <mark id="blok">prioritized to teach in 
      vocational/vocational programs</mark>. So, it would be better if PTIK was under the PTK department which oversees vocational programs 
      such as <mark id="blok">Building Engineering Education</mark>, and <mark id="blok">Mechanical Engineering Education</mark>. To meet the needs of lecturers 
      in the field of information technology that cannot be met by the PTK department, PTIK will conduct <mark id="blok">resource sharing with the 
      mathematics study program.</mark></p>
