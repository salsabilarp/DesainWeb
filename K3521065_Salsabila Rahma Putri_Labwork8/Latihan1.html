    <h1>PTIK FKIP UNS</h1>
    <p>The<mark class="tanda">Faculty of Teacher Training and Education</mark>, <mark class="tanda">Sebelas Maret University</mark>, Surakarta is an 
        <mark class="tanda">Educational Personnel Education Institution (LPTK)</mark> which has 24 study programs in 6 majors. Each study program 
        has its own characteristics in producing <mark class="tanda">superior, strong and intelligent educational staff.</mark>
    <br><br>
      The <mark class="tanda">Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK)</mark> study program is planned to take shelter in the management of the 
      <mark class="tanda">Engineering and Vocational Education (PTK)</mark> department. This placement revises our previous statement, where the PTIK study 
      program is under the P.MIPA department. PTIK is a study program that will produce graduates who are <mark class="tanda">prioritized to teach in 
      vocational/vocational programs</mark>. So, it would be better if PTIK was under the PTK department which oversees vocational programs 
      such as <mark class="tanda">Building Engineering Education</mark>, and <mark class="tanda">Mechanical Engineering Education</mark>. To meet the needs of 
      lecturers in the field of information technology that cannot be met by the PTK department, PTIK will conduct <mark class="tanda">resource sharing with 
      the mathematics study program.</mark>
